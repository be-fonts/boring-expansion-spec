# `avar`—Axis Variations Table Version 2

The axis variations table (`avar`) is an optional table used in variable fonts. Version 1 of `avar` modifies aspects of how a design varies for different instances along a particular design-variation axis. It does this by piecewise linear remapping on a per-axis basis, with certain restrictions. See the [OpenType specification](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/avar) for details.

Version 2, as proposed here, enables more flexible axis remapping where each design-variation axis is modified according to the coordinates of multiple design-variation axes. In order to combine the effects of multiple input values, `avar` version 2 uses the OpenType Variations mechanism itself to determine interpolated delta values and add them to design-variation axis coordinates.

The efficiency of `avar` version 2 enables fonts that:

* are significantly smaller;
* are easier for users to control;
* simplify source maintenance by avoiding redundant data.

Use cases include:

* warped variable font designspaces to reflect a typeface designer’s intention accurately;
* parametric fonts with intuitive control methods and a much reduced data footprint;
* offering simpler methods of control for specialized variable fonts.

# avar version 2.0 header format

| Type	| Name	| Description |
| ------|-------|-------------|
| `uint16`	| `majorVersion`	| Major version number of the axis variations table — set to 2. |
| `uint16`	| `minorVersion`	| Minor version number of the axis variations table — set to 0. |
| `uint16`	| `<reserved>`	| Permanently reserved; set to zero. |
| `uint16`	| `axisSegmentMapCount`	| The number of *axisSegmentMap*s for this font. If this is not 0, it must be the same as *axisCount* in the 'fvar' table. |
| `SegmentMaps`	| `axisSegmentMaps[axisSegmentMapCount]` | The segment maps array — one segment map for each axis, in the order of axes specified in the 'fvar' table. |
| `Offset32To<DeltaSetIndexMap>` | `axisIndexMapOffset` | Offset from beginning of the table to `axisIndexMap`. |
| `Offset32To<ItemVariationStore>` | `varStoreOffset` | Offset from beginning of the table to `varStore`. |

The table format for `avar` version 2 is the same as `avar` version 1, appended with offsets to two extra structures, `axisIndexMap` and `varStore`, and with the data for those structures.

`axisIndexMap` is a *DeltaSetIndexMap* structure that maps the axis indices implied in `fvar` to indices used in `varStore`. In the mapping, the index of each mapping entry is the axis index; the outer index identifies an *ItemVariationData* structure in `varStore`; the inner index identifies a *deltaSet* within an *ItemVariationData*. If either outer or inner index is 0xffff, then that axis’s value is ignored by the `avar` version 2 process. The number of mapping entries may be smaller than the number of axes in 'fvar', in which case remaining axes are ignored.

`varStore` is an *ItemVariationStore* structure that points to a *VariationRegions* array and a list of *ItemVariationData* structures. Each *ItemVariationData* specifies a subset of *VariationRegions* and an array of *deltaSets*. Each *deltaSet* specifies a delta value for each region.

Delta values are typically in the range [-1.0, 1.0] but are not strictly limited to that range. Delta values are stored as if they were signed integers by multiplying their true value by 16384. Thus 1.0 is stored as 16384; -1.0 is stored as -16384.

The *DeltaSetIndexMap* and *ItemVariationStore* formats are given in [OpenType Font Variations Common Table Formats](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/otvarcommonformats).

# Processing

Processing of axis values in an `avar` version 2 table happens in 3 stages for an instance determined by a set of user coordinates:

1. Convert user coordinates of each axis to initial normalized coordinates in the range [-1.0, 1.0]. (This step always happens in OpenType Variations.)
2. Remap initial normalized coordinates of each axis via the *axisSegmentMap*s, providing intermediate coordinates also in the range [-1.0, 1.0]. (This step is the usual `avar` version 1 remapping.)
3. Calculate interpolated deltas for each axis and add them to intermediate coordinates, providing final coordinates that are clamped to the range [-1.0, 1.0].

In more detail, step 3 proceeds as follows, using existing methods of processing *ItemVariationStore* structures:

* Considering the coordinates provided by step 2, calculate a scalar for each *variationRegion* in the *ItemVariationStore* by the usual variation interpolation algorithm.
* For each axis:
  * Look up its outer and inner indices in `axisIndexMap`.
  * The outer value identifies an *ItemVariationData*.
  * The inner value identifies a *deltaSet* within the *ItemVariationData*.
  * The *ItemVariationData* contains an array of *variationRegion* indices, implying an array of indices to scalars.
  * Multiply each scalar by the delta value at the same index, yielding an array of products. (We can do this since the array of region indices has the same length as the *deltaSet*.)
  * Take the sum of those products to obtain the interpolated delta value.
  * Add the interpolated delta value to the axis’s intermediate coordinate from step 2.
  * Clamp the result to the range [-1.0, 1.0], providing the final normalized coordinate for the axis.

The set of final axis coordinates obtained by step 3 is subsequently used in the standard variation process described in [Algorithm for Interpolation of Instance Values](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/otvaroverview#algorithm-for-interpolation-of-instance-values), applying to all `gvar` data and all *ItemVariationStore* data elsewhere in the font.

The following algorithm implements step 3 above, producing the final normalized axis coordinates:

```c++
    // let coords be the vector of current normalized coordinates.

    std::vector<int> out;
    for (unsigned i = 0; i < coords.size(); i++)
    {
      int v = coords[i];
      uint32_t varidx = i;
      
      if (axisIdxMap != 0)
        varidx = (this+axisIdxMap).map(varidx);
      
      float delta = 0;
      
      if (varStore != 0)
        delta = (this+varStore).get_delta (varidx, coords);

      v += std::roundf (delta);
      v = std::clamp (v, -(1<<14), +(1<<14));

      out.push_back (v);
    }
    for (unsigned i = 0; i < coords.size(); i++)
      coords[i] = out[i];
```

# Construction

The way `ItemVariationStore`s are built is typically by using a variation modeler, that takes a series of _master_ values at certain locations in the design-space, and produces `VariationRegion`s and `deltaSets` to be stored in one or more `ItemVariationData` structures. This usage is identical, except that delta values apply to normalized axis coordinates rather than distances measured in font units. To build the `avar` version 2 mapping tables, the designer will need to produce a mapping of input axis locations and their respective output axis locations. This data then will constitute the set of _masters_ to be fed to the variation modeler and populate the `ItemVariationStore` that will go into the `avar` version 2 table. The variation index for each axis will be stored in `axisIndexMap`.


# Use cases

## 1. Designspace warping

In the OpenType variations specification, [registered axes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/dvaraxisreg) offer a standard way to offer users control of a variable font on reasonably well defined scales. For example, users learn that the Regular version of a font has Weight=400, Width=100, while the Bold has wght=700, wdth=100. A typical 2-axis variable font with `wght` and `wdth` axes might have the following nine Named Instances:


|  | **wdth=75** | **wdth=100** | **wdth=125** |
| --- |---|---|---|
| **wght=300**   | Light Condensed | Light | Light Extended |
| **wght=400** | Condensed | Regular | Extended |
| **wght=700**    | Bold Condensed | Bold | Bold Extended |

However, in fonts with more than one design axis, this approach lacks the flexibility of older methods of interpolation, where the type designer used a font design application to specify freely the axis values for, say, the Bold Condensed. Notably, the `wght` coordinate of Bold Condensed did not need to match the `wght` coordinate of Bold, nor did the `wdth` coordinate of Bold Condensed need to match the `wdth` coordinate of Condensed. A Bold Condensed with `wght`,`wdth` of (677,81) rather than (700,75) was perfectly reasonable. Our grid of instances in such as case would look something like this:

|  | **Condensed** | **Regular** | **Expanded** |
| --- |---|---|---|
| **Light**   | 300,75 | 300,100 | 300,115 |
| **Regular** | 400,75 | 400,100 | 400,120 |
| **Bold**    | 677,81 | 695,100 | 700,125 |

While with OpenType 1.8 it is possible to set up a designspace like this, it has the significant drawback that many applications and systems expect all Bold weights to be at `wght`=700 and all Condensed weights to be at `wdth`=75, whatever the values of other axes. In practice, many OpenType 1.8 fonts encode numerous additional masters that ensure the design is as intended at all designspace locations. This not only increases the data footprint significantly, but also adds to the maintenance burden of the font.

Furthermore, there are many cases where a type designer does not intend to offer instances in certain regions of the design space. For example, a Black Condensed instance is often difficult to design, and many type families omit it. Desired behaviour, in case a user requests `wght`=900, `wdth`=75, may be for the font to provide the same instance for the Black Condensed as it does for the Bold Condensed. Luc(as) de Groot analyses the issue in his [Typo Labs 2018 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I75Efo7whrs&t=35m48s), where he calls for “virtual masters”.

By applying deltas to axis values anywhere in the designspace, the `avar` table version 2 “warps” the designspace and so resolves the issues described.

As with variation deltas in general, we also benefit from interpolation when axis values are influenced by a delta but are not exactly at the location of the delta. Each delta value is encoded as F2DOT14. Its interpolated value is determined by the standard OpenType variations algorithm, then added to the value obtained from the standard normalization process. Thus, assuming the Bold Condensed instance at (700,75) has normalized coordinates (1,-1) and assuming the designspace location (677,81) has normalized coordinates ((677-400)/(700-400), -1 + (81-75)/(100-75)) = (0.9233,-0.76), then the `ItemVariationStore` needs a delta set with peaks at (-1,1), thus with region ((-1,-1,0),(0,1,1)) and the following delta values:

* `wght` -0.0767
* `wdth` +0.24

In practice there may be other delta sets required at the partial default locations (-1,0) and (0,1), which then influence the delta values required at (-1,1), in line with normal variations math.

The result of implementing designspace warping this way is that we preserve the original axis values where applications and systems expect them, namely all Bold instances at `wght`=700 and all Condensed weights at `wdth`=75, while at the same time minimizing the data footprint.


## 2. Duplication of axis values for non-linear interpolation

Certain variable fonts encode delta sets in such a way that, when multiple axes are synchronized, outline points move in curves rather than in straight lines. This technique was [invented by Underware](https://underware.nl/case-studies/hoi/) and [presented in 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVMukTiElUQ) under the name HOI (higher order interpolation). The details of the non-linear encoding need not concern us here, but a practical drawback under OpenType 1.8 is that it requires users to set multiple design axes to identical values in order to obtain valid instances. When axes are not synchronized, the resulting glyphs are severely distorted and useless. Synchronization using JavaScript has been proposed as a solution. A clever exploit of the CFF2 format, allowing a single axis to perform all the necessary non-linear adjustment of outline points, has also been demonstrated (but this method cannot be adapted to adjust delta values in an *ItemVariationStore* non-linearly).

The `avar` version 2 table provides a solution to the synchonization problem, such that a user adjusts one “primary” axis and that value is cloned to other subordinate axes. Ideally the subordinate axes have the Hidden flag set in `fvar` to discourage manual operation. For a font with 3 axes requiring identical values, if the first axis is considered primary, then the other two can encode delta sets in `avar`’s *ItemVariationStore* to clone the value of the first axis. Assuming the subordinate axes have the same minimum, default and maximum values as the primary axis, each subordinate axis requires either one or two delta sets to clone the negative and positive regions of the normalized value of the primary axis:

* If the axes use only the normalized region [0,1] then one delta set per subordinate axis is needed, referring to the region (0,1,1) of the primary axis and having the delta value of 1. This is the common case.

* If the axes use only the normalized region [-1,0] then one delta set per subordinate axis is needed, referring to the region (-1,-1,0) of the primary axis and having the delta value of -1.

* If the axes use both the normalized regions [-1,0] and [0,1] then two delta sets per subordinate axis are needed, one referring to the region (0,1,1) of the primary axis and having the delta value of 1, the other referring to the region (-1,-1,0) of the primary axis and having the delta value of -1.


## 3. Simplified controls for parametric fonts without redundant data

Parametric fonts, explored by [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafont) and others, offer fine-tuned control of specific font-wide aspects of their design. Such aspects typically include the thickness of vertical strokes, thickness of horizontal strokes, the overall width of the font, and direct control over vertical zones including cap-height, ascender height, x-height and descender height.

In an OpenType variable font these parameters can be encoded as design-variation axes. The [Type Network Variations Proposal](https://variationsguide.typenetwork.com) of 2017 provides the basis for parametric OpenType fonts [Amstelvar](https://github.com/googlefonts/amstelvar), [Roboto Flex](https://github.com/googlefonts/roboto-flex) and others, demonstrating the potential for usable parametric fonts with large character sets. That flexibility comes from a designspace of many axes – sometimes 10 or more – which raises issues of control. Faced with 10 sliders, users are unlikely to be able to find the instance they want and are likely to get “lost” in a unusable region of the designspace.

In OpenType 1.8, the solution to getting “lost” is to include “blended” axes that combine the deltas of parametric axes in such a way that they function in exactly the same way as they would in a non-parametric font. The blended axes are exposed using the registered axes of `wght`, `wdth`, `opsz`, etc., or well specified custom axes, and they are encoded in the standard OpenType 1.8 manner using `gvar` and related data. The major problem with such fonts is their large data footprint, as the blended axes effectively replicate much of what the parametric axes do. For a font containing both parametric and blended axes, the problem is particularly acute, so the parametric axes may be omitted to save space — thereby removing core functionality. In such cases the parametric nature of the font is thus reduced to a convenience of sources.

The `avar` table version 2 provides a method to deploy a purely parametric font with user-friendly axes, while avoiding the data bloat of blended axes. The user axes, for example `wght` and `wdth`, on their own do nothing (i.e. they have no `gvar` or similar data), but they control the parametric axes by means of `avar`. The blending of parametric values into user-facing values effectively happens live in the font engine. The parametric axes are expected to have the Hidden flag set in `fvar` to discourage (but not block) manual operation.


# Inverse avar processing

In fonts with an `avar` version 2 table, it can be useful to know the axis values that would invoke a given instance if the font engine did not support `avar` version 2. Use cases include:

* informing users of the effective settings of parametric axes;
* providing a polyfill for `avar` version 2.

Normally it is not possible for an application to obtain normalized axis values directly, these remaining private to the font engine. A solution is for the application itself to implement the `avar` algorithms, both version 1 and version 2. This requires not only access to the binary `avar` table, but also knowledge of the font’s axis extents as defined in the `fvar` table. Once an application has a complete set of final normalized values as defined above, the inverse of the `avar` version 1 algorithm can be applied to obtain user coordinates for all axes. (Care must be taken to avoid a divide-by-zero error in implementing an inverse `avar` version 1 mapping, in cases where consecutive *toCoordinate* values are identical.)

Almost all fonts can provide a valid set of user axis coordinates for a given set of final normalized axis coordinates in this way. Exceptions are those fonts that encode deltas in a region that is not accessible without `avar` version 2, namely those fonts where the `fvar` definition of an axis normally precludes an active negative region or an active positive region by having its default equal to its minimum or its maximum respectively. Such cases are expected to be rare.


# Recommendations and notes

## Hidden axes

Since many `avar` version 2 fonts have axes not not intended for manual adjustment, it is recommended that such axes set the “hidden” flag in `VariationAxisRecord` of the [`fvar`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/fvar) table.

## Efficient ItemVariationStore construction

For axes that do not have `avar` version 2 adjustments, either use the special value 0xffff for both outer and inner indices in `axisIndexMap` or reorder the axes such that the non-participating axes are at the end and `axisIndexMap` can have fewer entries.

To reduce proliferation of zero deltas, consider grouping axes in terms of the axes they depend upon. Each group can be represented by its own *ItemVariationData* structure, thus using smaller *deltaSet*s that do not refer to irrelevant axes.

## Other notes

* The set of axes involved in adjusting the coordinate for a given axis may include the axis itself.

* It is expected that implementations that handle only `avar` version 1 will ignore the entire table by rejecting the *majorVersion* value.
