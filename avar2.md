# `avar`—Axis Variations Table Version 2

The axis variations table (`avar`) is an optional table used in variable fonts. Version 1 of the `avar` can be used to modify aspects of how a design varies for different instances along a particular design-variation axis. Version 2 as proposed here allows modifying the design-space across multiple design-variation axes simultanously.

# Table format

Axis variation table:

| Type	| Name	| Description |
| ------|-------|-------------|
| `uint16`	| `majorVersion`	| Major version number of the axis variations table — set to 2. |
| `uint16`	| `minorVersion`	| Minor version number of the axis variations table — set to 0. |
| `uint16`	| `<reserved>`	| Permanently reserved; set to zero. |
| `uint16`	| `axisCount`	| The number of variation axes for this font. This must be the same number as axisCount in the 'fvar' table. |
| `SegmentMaps`	| `axisSegmentMaps[axisCount]`	| The segment maps array — one segment map for each axis, in the order of axes specified in the 'fvar' table. |
| `Offset32To<DeltaSetIndexMap>` | **`axisIdxMap`** | Offset from beginning of the table, to optional DeltaSetIndexMap storing variation index mapping. |
| `Offset32To<ItemVariationStore>` | **`varStore`** | Offset from beginning of the table, to optional ItemVariationStore storing variations. |

 `SegmentMaps` is the same as in `avar` [version 1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/avar#table-formats).

The table format for `avar` table version 2 is the same as `avar` table version 1 followed by two extra members `axisIdxMap` and `varStore`. However, because the version 2 table uses `majorVersion` 2, an older implementation would not be able to interpret a version 2 table even though structurally it begins the same was as a version 1 table.

# Processing

Processing of axis values in a `avar` version 2 table starts off the same as a `avar` version 1 table. That is, axis coordinates are normalized and then mapped according to `axisSegmentMaps`. After that, the following algorithm is applied to produce the final normalized axis coordinates:

```c++
    // let coords be the vector of current normalized coordinates.

    std::vector<int> out;
    for (unsigned i = 0; i < coords.size(); i++)
    {
      int v = coords[i];
      uint32_t varidx = i;
      
      if (axisIdxMap != 0)
        varidx = (this+axisIdxMap).map(varidx);
      
      float delta = 0;
      
      if (varStore != 0)
        delta = (this+varStore).get_delta (varidx, coords);

      v += std::roundf (delta);
      v = std::clamp (v, -(1<<14), +(1<<14));

      out.push_back (v);
    }
    for (unsigned i = 0; i < coords.size(); i++)
      coords[i] = out[i];
```

# Discussion

This table uses the same variation mechanism used in multiple other places in OpenType 1.8, to vary normalized axis values themselves. In particular, variation deltas are stored in an `ItemVariationStore`, and the variation indices are stored in a `DeltaSetIndexMap`.

The processing is broken into two steps: let's call them the v1 and v2 steps. The v1 step is the same as an `avar` version 1 table. The v2 step is the algorithm listed above. The `ItemVariationStore` is driven with the normalized axis values generated by the v1 step, to produce deltas to add to those same normalized axis values, to produce the final normalized axis values. It is this step that allows arbitrary multi-axis transformation, because unlike the v1 step, the delta for, and hence adjustment to, each axis can be affected by the input value of every axis.

# Construction

The way `ItemVariationStore`s are built is typically by using a variation modeler, that takes a series of _master_ values at certain locations in the design-space, and produces delta-sets to be stored in an `ItemVariationStore`. This usage is no different. To build the `avar` version 2 mapping tables, the designer will need to produce a mapping of input axis locations and their respective output axis locations. This data then will constitute the set of _masters_ to be fed to the variation modeler and populate the `ItemVariationStore` that will go into the `avar` version 2 table. The variation index for each axis will be stored in `axisIdxMap`.
